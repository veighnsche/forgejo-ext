// owner and returns a context carrying that execution for nested
// participating writers; nested writers reuse the enclosing ownership
// instead of claiming again. An idle reservation returns the context
// unchanged so ordinary callbacks keep existing behavior. A held
// reservation without a matching proof refuses before any effect: callbacks
// reenter only with host-authenticated execution binding and never borrow
// another owner's authority. The capability path is attached only when the
// file at that path holds the same secret, so bound grandchildren of the
// callback keep proving the same execution.
