// Conditional publish (git.ref.publish) receive protocol contract.
//
// The conditional receive is a new generic Fountain protocol on the smart-HTTP
// transport: a registered operation's publisher pushes exactly its authorized
// tuple through receive-pack, and the server binds that receive to the
// installation/actor/operation before Git starts. This file pins the
// transport-shape points of that contract that are decidable without the held
// operation seam:
//
//   - Only git-receive-pack serves a conditional publish. Upload-pack,
//     upload-archive and the dumb-HTTP endpoints never consume a registration;
//     discovery reads do not consume execution.
//   - The Git-Protocol header passes through under the existing native
//     allowlist, unchanged. Operation binding never travels in that header,
//     so no new header value is accepted here.
//   - Operation binding is never a push option. The conditional receive
//     rejects every push option, which also keeps policy push options from
//     smuggling intent past the registered tuple.
//
// The operation binding travels in two request headers on the supported
// receive-pack route, alongside the native PAT basic authentication:
//   - PublishOperationHeader carries the registered operation ID.
//   - The background admission header (sdk.AdmissionHeader) carries the
//     current installation runtime/service admission.
//
// Either header present selects the conditional receive; a half-present or
// malformed binding refuses without touching the reservation. Unmodified
// Forgejo implements no such protocol: it ignores both headers and serves
// an ordinary push. The admission value is a bearer secret: it must never
// appear in command arguments, child environments, logs or diagnostics.
